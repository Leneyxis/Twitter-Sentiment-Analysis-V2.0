# Twitter Sentiment Analysis and School of Thought Categorization

## Overview

This project extends the classic Twitter sentiment analysis by categorizing tweets according to popular schools of thought. The goal is to analyze how people's responses on Twitter align with broader philosophical or ideological frameworks, providing deeper insights into human behavior and belief systems.

## Motivation

While traditional sentiment analysis classifies tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories, this project aims to explore the connection between online behavior and various schools of thought. Understanding these connections can offer valuable insights into how public opinions and reactions are influenced by underlying beliefs and ideologies.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **School of Thought Categorization**: Assigns tweets to different schools of thought based on their content.
- **Data Visualization**: Visual representations of the analysis, including word clouds and hashtag trends.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (NLTK, spaCy)
- Machine Learning models (Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression)
- Data Visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud)

## Usage

1. Collect Twitter data using the Twitter API or load a pre-existing dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (cleaning, tokenization, etc.).
3. Run the sentiment analysis model:
   ```bash
   python sentiment_analysis.py
   ```
4. Categorize tweets into schools of thought:
   ```bash
   python school_of_thought_categorization.py
   ```
5. Visualize the results:
   ```bash
   python visualize.py
   ```
